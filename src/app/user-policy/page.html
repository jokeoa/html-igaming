        <div class="date-info">
          <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> September 23, 2025</p>
          <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> September 23, 2025</p>
        </div>

        <h3>1. Purpose and Scope</h3>
        <p>
          This User Policy governs your access to and use of the HTML Casino
          educational platform, a demonstration website developed by students at
          Astana IT University. This platform serves exclusively educational
          purposes and provides demonstration gameplay experiences without
          monetary transactions or real gambling activities.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Educational Nature and Disclaimer</h3>
        <p>
          HTML Casino operates as a purely educational and demonstration
          platform. The website does not facilitate actual gambling, does not
          accept real money wagers, and does not provide opportunities for
          monetary gains or losses. All gaming features are implemented for
          educational purposes to demonstrate web development technologies and
          user interface design principles.
        </p>

        <p>
          Users acknowledge that this platform does not promote, encourage, or
          facilitate real gambling activities. The demonstration games available
          on this platform are designed to showcase technical implementation
          rather than provide authentic gambling experiences.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Acceptable Use Guidelines</h3>
        <p>
          Users are expected to utilize the platform in a manner consistent with
          its educational objectives. Access to the platform is provided for
          learning purposes, technical evaluation, and constructive feedback
          regarding web development implementation.
        </p>

        <p>
          Users must not attempt to circumvent, modify, or exploit any technical
          features of the platform. Any attempts to manipulate the demonstration
          games or access unauthorized areas of the website are prohibited and
          may result in immediate access restrictions.
        </p>

        <p>
          The platform should not be used as a substitute for or introduction to
          real gambling activities. Users seeking actual gambling experiences
          should utilize properly licensed and regulated gambling platforms
          appropriate for their jurisdiction.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Age Restrictions and Accessibility</h3>
        <p>
          While this platform does not involve real gambling, access is
          recommended for users aged 18 and above to maintain consistency with
          gambling-related content standards. Educational institutions and
          supervised learning environments may provide access to younger users
          for legitimate academic purposes.
        </p>

        <p>
          Users accessing the platform for educational purposes should do so
          under appropriate supervision when required by their academic
          institution or local regulations.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Content and Intellectual Property</h3>
        <p>
          All content, design elements, and source code on the HTML Casino
          platform remain the intellectual property of the development team and
          Astana IT University. Users may view and interact with the platform
          content for educational purposes but may not reproduce, distribute, or
          commercially utilize any platform elements without explicit
          permission.
        </p>

        <p>
          The demonstration games and interface elements are provided for
          educational evaluation and should not be replicated for commercial
          gambling platforms or real money gaming applications.
        </p>

        <h3>6. User Feedback and Contributions</h3>
        <p>
          The development team welcomes constructive feedback regarding
          technical implementation, user interface design, and educational
          value. Users are encouraged to submit suggestions and report technical
          issues through the designated issue tracking system.
        </p>

        <p>
          All feedback and suggestions submitted by users become available for
          consideration by the development team. Users retain no proprietary
          rights over submitted feedback, which may be incorporated into future
          platform iterations without compensation or attribution requirements.
        </p>

        <h3>7. Privacy and Data Handling</h3>
        <p>
          The platform operates with minimal data collection practices
          consistent with its educational purpose. User interactions are logged
          solely for technical functionality and educational assessment
          purposes. No personal financial information is collected, stored, or
          processed through this platform.
        </p>

        <p>
          Users should not provide any sensitive personal information, financial
          details, or confidential data through the platform interface. The
          demonstration nature of the platform does not require such information
          for any legitimate functionality.
        </p>

        <h3>8. Technical Limitations and Availability</h3>
        <p>
          Users acknowledge that HTML Casino operates as a student development
          project and may experience technical limitations, temporary
          unavailability, or functional restrictions. The platform is provided
          on an "as available" basis without guarantees of continuous operation
          or error-free performance.
        </p>

        <p>
          The development team endeavors to maintain platform functionality
          during active development periods but cannot guarantee uninterrupted
          service or immediate resolution of technical issues.
        </p>

        <h3>9. Modification of Terms</h3>
        <p>
          This User Policy may be updated periodically to reflect changes in
          platform functionality, educational objectives, or regulatory
          requirements. Users are responsible for reviewing policy updates and
          continuing use of the platform constitutes acceptance of any
          modifications.
        </p>

        <p>
          Significant policy changes will be communicated through appropriate
          channels available to the user community and academic supervisors when
          applicable.
        </p>

        <h3>10. Contact and Support</h3>
        <p>
          Questions regarding this User Policy, platform functionality, or
          educational applications should be directed to the development team
          through the official project repository or designated academic
          channels at Astana IT University.
        </p>

        <p>
          Users experiencing technical difficulties or seeking clarification
          regarding acceptable use should utilize the established feedback
          mechanisms rather than attempting unauthorized access or modification
          of platform features.
